The code for my research paper "Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation in Mobile MMO: A Study of Interpersonal Influence in Sky: Children of Light"
This study uses an innovative graph-based machine learning algorithm to investigate social influence dynamics in the mobile MMO Sky: Children of the Light. The study applies the COM-B model to explore how Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation shape networked influence. Our findings reveal distinct contributions of each COM-B model factor to players' social influence. Capability enhances influence, but a high focus on task completion correlates negatively with influence. Opportunity is the strongest predictor, as active social interactions significantly boost influence. Motivation varies by playstyle, with socializers and competitors showing greater influence than narrative-focused players.  Extending the COM-B model to digital gaming contexts, this research highlights new behavioral dimensions and introduces innovative metrics for measuring influence. These findings hold practical implications for fostering inclusivity and social interaction in game design, shedding lights on game elements that could encourage the changes in playersâ€™ behaviors, offering actionable strategies to create more engaging and equitable digital environments.
